	<h1>Andrew's AR Test Website</h1>
	<p>Click on the image below with an iPhone/iPad with iOS 12+ and it will automatically bring you into an AR experience without any outside app download or external hoops to jump through. And yes, this website looks like I made it in 2003, but this is just a test embedding AR on a webpage. I'll be creative later and make a modern site or a mock sales page with AR demos for each product or just have an easy way to mass share AR files if I make a fire AR post on Reddit and get a bunch of engagement by letting them try it out too instead of a video of me having fun with it idk.</p>
